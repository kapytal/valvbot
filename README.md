# valvbot - an AI bot to buy and sell crypto in whatsapp privately

## Why
Because if we want crypto to be massive we must go to where the masses are. Whatsapp is used by billions of people.
If we allow people to get into crypto through whatsapp we can enable 5 minute remmitances (for example). No more "download this app" or "keep your seed phrase safe"

### GPT?
Yes, because that way no matter how "silly" your question is regarding crypto, Valve will always answer politely and in a friendly manner.

## Instructions
1. Send a whatsapp message to our phonenumber with the code `join left-cheese`. The easiest way to do it is visit our [website](https://valv.bubbleapps.io/version-test) and clicking in the Whatsapp link from your phone 
2. Start chatting with Valv. If you are a new user Valve will create a solana address for you automatically. (you can ask Valve to tell you your address anytime by asking for your balance)

### How to buy
Send a message to Valve saying you want to buy. It will guide you through the process:
1) **Amount**
2) **Payment method:** for bank transfer it will send you a bank account and reference.

### How to sell
Send a message to Valve saying you want to sell. You are only able to sell the USDC that is in your Solana/Valve wallet.

### How to deposit
Just ask for your balance. Valve will remind you your wallet address. Send some USDC in Solana network and once it arrives Valve will notify you.
